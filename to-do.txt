TO DO LIST

* proper exception handling

* multflight state/config dump to ease restarting

* clock based dummy mode (e.g. 6 hours RT <--> 5min real)?

* remote logging from model messaging interface script and task_dummy.py:
  + if a message gets through to the right in-controller task object, it will
  be logged by the controller (DONE)
  + if it fails, attempt to contact the controller's dead-letter object
  and it will be logged, with a warning, from there (DONE?) 
  + finally, in case the controller itself if dead, log to a dedicated
  non-controller log.
