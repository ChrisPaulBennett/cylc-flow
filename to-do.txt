TO DO LIST

* retrofit proper exception handling

* state/config restart capability

* remote logging from model messaging interface script and task_dummy.py,
  in case the controller itself is dead.

* make sure spent task removal works if we're not running topnet

* use methods is_running(), is_finished(), etc. to determine task state
  instead of than accessing attributes directly

* dead soldier should be info, not debug?
