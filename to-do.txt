TO DO LIST

* potential bug in free_task class: will never run if too many previous
  instances exist that are newer than the task deletion cutoff

* allow some (most) tasks to be deleted earlier than the main cutoff

* retrofit proper exception handling

* remote logging from send_message and task_dummy,
  in case the controller itself is dead.
