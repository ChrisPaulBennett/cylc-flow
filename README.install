Cylc requires Python 2.4 or later, for:
    * pygtk (gui)
    * the subprocess module

Python 2.4 was released in November 2004.

For Python 2.3:
   * subprocess could be replaced with the older os.system.
   * it would not be possible to use the cylc GTK gui, but
     the older 'cylc monitor' command and 'cylc dump' etc.
     may be sufficient.
