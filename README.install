Cylc requires Python 2.4 or later, for:
    * pygtk (gui)
    * the subprocess module

Python 2.4 was released in November 2004.

For Python 2.3:
   * Subprocess could be replaced with the older os.system.
   * It would not be possible to use the cylc GTK GUI controller, but
     the older 'cylc tmon' monitor and commandline tools should be 
     perfectly sufficient.
