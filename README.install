Sequenz should be installed to an external (non-repository) location.
TO DO: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

For development purposes, however, sequenz can be run from the top level
of the source repository itself. This should obviously be done in a
branch, not in the master repository, in case of accidental source
corruption.
