Print private or central suite registrations.

the general wildcard is '.*' (match zero or more of anything), NOT '*'.
  (b) For our purposes there is an implicit wildcard at the end of each
pattern ('foo' is the same as 'foo.*'); use the string end marker to
stop this ('foo$' matches only literal 'foo').""" )
