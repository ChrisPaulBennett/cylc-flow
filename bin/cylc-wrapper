# Cylc task wrapper script

# Cylc tasks must send, at the least, their own 'started', 'succeeded',
# and 'failed' messages. This script allows cylc to control existing
# tasks that have not been modified to do their own cylc messaging.

# It does the following:
# (1) sends special 'started' message
# (2) executes the wrapped task (passes any commandline on)
# (3) sends the special 'succeed' message on completion,
#     or the special 'failed' message if an error occurs.

# It is assumed that wrapped tasks return the standard shell exit codes
# for success or failure. Wrapped tasks can also send their own cylc
# messages, but in that case you might as well dispense with wrapping
# and provide the started, finished, and failed messages as well.

set -e; trap 'cylc task-failed "error trapped"' ERR

# send the startup message
cylc task-started || exit 1

# only need to check for $WRAP here.
if [[ -z $WRAP ]]; then
    cylc task-failed "ERROR, cylc-wrapper: \$WRAP not found"
    exit 1
fi

# execute the wrapped task and check for success or failure
if $WRAP $@; then 
    # succeeded
    cylc task-message --all-outputs-completed
    cylc task-finished
else
    # failed
    cylc task-failed 
fi
