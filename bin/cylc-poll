Poll a 'submitted' or 'running' or 'all' task(s) to verify the status(es).
If a job was killed by external means this will update the suite accordingly.

Note that automatic job polling can used to track task status on task
hosts that do not allow any communication by RPC (pyro) or ssh back to
the suite host - see site/user config file documentation.

Polling is also done automatically on restarting a suite, for any tasks
that were recorded as submitted or running when the suite went down.
