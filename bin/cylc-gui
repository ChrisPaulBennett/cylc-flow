This is the cylc Graphical User Interface; it is functionally equivalent
to the Command Line Interface in most respects (see 'cylc help').
Right-click on suites or groups to access cylc functionality from
suite editing and graphing through to suite control and monitoring.

The '-t,--timeout' timeout option affects port scanning to detect
running suites. 

NOTE: to daemonize suites launched from the GUI use POSIX nohup command:
    $ nohup gcylc [OPTIONS] &""", argdoc=[])
