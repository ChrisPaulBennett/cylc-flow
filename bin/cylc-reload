Reload the suite definition at run time. This allows:
 (a) changing task config such as command scripting or environment;
 (b) adding tasks to, or removing them from, the suite definition,
at run time, i.e. without shutting the suite down and restarting it.
(It is easy to shut down and restart a cylc suite, but this may be
useful if you don't want to wait for long-running tasks to finish
first.)

Note that *defined tasks* can be already be added to or removed from a
running suite with the 'cylc insert' and 'cylc remove' commands. This
command also allows addition and removal of actual task definitions,
and therefore insertion of tasks that were not even defined when the
suite started (you will still need to manually insert a particular
instance of a newly defined task). Orphaned task proxies (those whose
task definitions have been deleted) will be removed from the task pool 
if they have not started running yet.

Suite logging and state directories cannot be reconfigured on reload;
everything else, including internal queues, can be.

Changes to task definitions take effect immediately, unless a task is 
already running at reload time.

If the updated suite definition does not parse, failure to reload will
be reported, but no harm will be done to the running suite.""", pyro=True )
