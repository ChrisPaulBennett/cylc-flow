# Cylc task wrapper script.

# Allows cylc to control existing tasks that have not been modified to
# do their own cylc messaging. It can only be used for tasks that:
# (a) see their processing through till the end (as opposed to
#    submitting or spawning subprocesses and then exiting), and 
# (b) return non-zero exit status for failure. 

# The task wrapper does the following:
# (1) sends special 'started' message
# (2) executes the wrapped task, with any commandline arguments
# (3) if success: reports all registered outputs completed and finishes
#     if failure: reports failure.

# Wrapped tasks can also send their own cylc messages, which will be
# logged by cylc, but must not send their own start/finished/failed or
# registered output messages.
