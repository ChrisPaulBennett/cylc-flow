# THIS IS A CYLC TASK CLASS DEFINITION FILE


%TASK
    ricom_cold, ri_c

%DESCRIPTION
    Oneoff dummy task to supply initial RiCOM restart prerequisites.
    The real restart file(s) are assumed to have been provided
    by an initial external spinup experiment.
    Ricom will fail if it runs out of restart files (4 available) but capture the failure and automatically do a cold start. 
    One week spinup is required before the output is considered usable.
