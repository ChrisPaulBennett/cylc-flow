(This is closely related to pygraphviz but has many graph-theoretic
algorithms that may be useful?)

GRAPH STABILITY:

Small changes to graph content can cause large layout jumps - this is
probably inevitable. 

However, changes to the order of nodes and edges in the dot-file
for the *same* graph may also cause layout changes. I've traced 
this back to config.get_graph() for the cylc base graph and verified
that I'm sorting edges and nodes prior to adding them to the graph.
Thus the random(?) reordering seems to be a feature of the internals
of pygraphviz? (maybe it stores nodes in dicts in the underlying C
library...?)

CONSIDER ADDING LAYOUT ONCE to base graph, and thereafter only when new 
tasks are added to the graph?
