Weird problem with multiple calls to pygraphviz.layout(prog='dot') 
on the userguide suite:

If I rewrite the runtime graph each time it is updated, instead of once
at the end, with a call to layout() before each write, the cold start
tasks get bigger and bigger with each write, but only if they are 'egg'
shaped.

????

This may be a problem with the xdot viewer, on files that already have
layout added. RESOLVED by not calling layout() before writing the graph.
Calling layout() is not necessary if we're only writing to 'dot' format.
