# PARSING THE GRAPH

* each line,
  * split into pairs on arrows, iterate through pairs
    - pair.left groups can have AND, OR (i.e. conditional prereq)
    - pair.right can only have AND (i.e. all trigger off left)
    - in an OR group, the FIRST member will be used in graphs.
    - must allow conditional and non-conditional prereqs together.

* don't need tied task and auto restart prerequisites!:

___________-
    graph = A(T-12) | A(T-6) => A (with A sequential)

or to allow early triggering:
      graph = A:2(T-12) | A:1(T-6) => A* (sequential)
    (requires conditional OR prereq can handle "X or X")
    BETTER: just document that this is equivalent to:
      graph = A:1(T-6)
    so long as the extra outputs are generated!

    [[A]]
         spawn after output = 2  # !!!
         [[[outputs]]]
    1 = "restart files ready for $(T+6)"
    2 = "restart files ready for $(T+12)"
___________-

NOTE: for a *model* you don't need intercycle dependence IF you force it
to be sequential, EXCEPT at startup when the proper intercycle dependence
stops it from starting up before the cold start task.  But sequential is
of no use for e.g. UM(T-6) => OPS & VarConfigureLS.
