*  suicide prerequisites

* conditional trigger on failed => no longer need the 'completed' message?
  (which is set in outputs.py)

* clean up prerequisites classes - put all in one module?
* same with outputs + requisites?

* NEW? (re: Trevor's mos spin up for new stations):
    - a cycling task that stops at a given ctime? => foo(T)
    - pause a task
    - insert a prerequisite on the fly - e.g. trigger off foo when it reaches T
