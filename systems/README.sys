cylc systems (i.e. sets of related tasks to be controlled by cylc)
should be defined and maintained in their own repositories with version
tags to indicate which version of cylc they are compatible with. This
allows cylc development to continue without having to constantly
upgrade multiple task sets in the main repository.
