%NAME
    coldstart

%DESCRIPTION
    Provides the initial restart prerequisites for the forecast models.
    A real system would have separate cold start tasks for each model
    (and a dummy one to "fake" the outputs for any model that has to be
    "spun up" by external means before starting the scheduler).
    Depends on the system startup task.
