%NAME
    coldstart, cld

%DESCRIPTION
    Oneoff coldstart task for the userguide example system. This task
    provides the initial restart prerequisites for the forecast models
    (during warm cycling, i.e. once the system is running, these are
    provided by the previous forecasts).  A real system would likely
    have separate cold start tasks for each forecast model, to represent
    actual cold start processing: e.g. an initial forecast from a global
    model state to provide a background state for a limited-area model,
    or a series of runs to "spin up" the model to the initial cycle
    time. If these processes have been completed previously,
    independently of the cylc system, the the coldstart task(s) can be
    of the "tied, dummy" type, which means they will simply report that
    the restart outputs are ready for the first cycle. See the userguide
    for alternative ways of starting up a system (%COLDSTART_PREREQUISITES 
    or manual task reset).
