# NOTE: THE ITEMS IN THIS SPEC FILE SET NO DEFAULT VALUES, SO THEY MUST
# BE SET IN THE site.rc FILE (if not, file validation will report
# missing items and then abort).  It would be more efficient to put
# default values in here and just set any overrides in the site.rc file,
# but that would make it the available items less obvious to cylc
# admininstrators.
