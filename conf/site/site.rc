# THIS IS THE CYLC SITE CONFIGURATION FILE FOR PARAMETERS THAT USERS
# CANNOT OVERRIDE. See also $CYLC_DIR/conf/user/cylc.rc.

# Legal site config items are defined by $CYLC_DIR/conf/site/cfgspec

# This file is currently shipped empty. It only needs to be modified if
# you need to change the default values set in the cfgspec file.

# Example, to change the pyro port range:
#[pyro]
#    base port number = 7766
#    maximum number of ports = 200
