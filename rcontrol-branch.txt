1/ The graph control GUI now gets the graph structure from the suite, via
Pyro, instead of from a local config file parsed when the GUI starts up. 
Will this be a performance hit (either for the GUI or the suite) in
large suites?  If so, we could optionally allow the old method with 
the proviso that it would not work for remote controlled suites.

2/ To start a suite with the graph GUI, as opposed to connecting to a remote
suite, we still need to parse the config file to get, for example, configured
initial and final cycle times. 

3/ gcylc --host=FOO still starts up if FOO is an unknown host, and then tries
to start the suite locally.

3.5/ tree GUI currently needs task list before connecting to the suite.

4/ run suite from GUI after shutting down a remote suite, will attempt 
to run it locally.
