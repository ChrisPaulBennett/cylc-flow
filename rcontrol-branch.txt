The graph control GUI now gets the graph structure from the suite, via
Pyro, instead of from a local config file parsed when the GUI starts up. 
Will this be a performance hit (either for the GUI or the suite) in
large suites?  If so, we could optionally allow the old method with 
the proviso that it would not work for remote controlled suites.
