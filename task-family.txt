Task family F, with members A, B, C

Is a task proxy that does not launch a real task. It can optionally have
explicit prerequisites and outputs defined, but it automatically depends
on all of its members finishing, through ("familyfinished"
prerequisites), at which point it sets its own outputs completed and
enters the finished state.

If in addition, A,B,C declare themselves to be members of F, it
results in them automatically depending on F starting.  If they don't,
then they don't have to wait on F before starting as a group, but F can
still be used as a "group finished" event that others can depend on.
