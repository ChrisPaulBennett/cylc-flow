Task family F, with members A, B, C

Is a task proxy with prerequisites (none, or possibly some others),
and outputs (default, and possibly some others)

A,B,C declare themselves to be members of F, which results in them auto
depending on F starting.

If A,B,C don't declare, then F is a "group finished" indicator!

F has no task (not even dummy) so no external task to complete its
outputs. Instead it has special "finished prerequisites" that depend on
its members all finishing; when satisfied it sets its own outputs
completed.
