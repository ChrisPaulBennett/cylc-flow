TO BE DOCUMENTED:

* To dummy out a task, comment out its command list.

* Although cylc internals can easily handle different task
commands, environment, outputs etc., at different times,
I think this would rarely be needed (however: EXAMPLE
different n_restart_outputs for a model that does a short
forecast at 0,12 and long forecast at 6,18). To change this,
use more 'if HOUR in ...' conditionals in taskdef.py, as for
prerequisites via the dependency graph cycle-time lists, and some
interface to this in config.py (which however should be designed
not to further complicate suite.rc files for general use).

* auto task insertion group: "all coldstart tasks"

* duplicate keywords (e.g. dependency graph labels) in suite.rc
  result in a configobj.DuplicateError.

* special outputs do not result in dependence on the upstream task
  itself, just the output. Thus a oneoff task used to recover from 
  failure of another task can generate the same output as the task
  is emulating.
