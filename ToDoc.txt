TO BE DOCUMENTED:
1/ To dummy out a task, comment out its command list.
2/ Although cylc internals can easily handle different task
commands, environment, outputs etc., at different times,
I think this would rarely be needed (however: EXAMPLE
different n_restart_outputs for a model that does a short
forecast at 0,12 and long forecast at 6,18). To change this,
use more 'if HOUR in ...' conditionals in taskdef.py, as for
prerequisites via the dependency graph cycle-time lists, and some
interface to this in config.py (which however should be designed
not to further complicate suite.rc files for general use).
