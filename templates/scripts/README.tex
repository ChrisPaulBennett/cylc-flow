See also {\em Task Wrapping} (Section~\ref{TaskWrapping}), which allows
cylc to control unmodified external tasks.

\lstset{language=bash}

The cylc task messaging commands read the task name and cycle time from
their execution environment and use these to target the correct task
proxy object in the running scheduler.

If a task is executed manually or by \lstinline=cylc submit=, the cylc
messaging interface just prints messages to stdout or stderr.
