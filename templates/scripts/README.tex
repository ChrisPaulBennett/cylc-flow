See also {\em Task Wrapping} (Section~\ref{TaskWrapping}), which allows
cylc to control unmodified external tasks (i.e.\ you don't need to 
use the task scripts described in this section).

\lstset{language=bash}

When called by a task script, the cylc task messaging scripts read the task
name and cycle time from their execution environment and use these to
target the correct task proxy object in the running scheduler.

If a task script is executed manually or by \lstinline=cylc submit=
cylc messages will be printed to stdout and no attempt will be made to
communicate with a task proxy object registered in a Pyro nameserver.
