        group as a whole. In these circumstances, this signal does
        not get handled. Bash waits for the (unsignalled) child to
        complete. This does not apply to jobs with proper 'steps'
        (e.g. using srun within an sbatch script), which are properly
        signalled.

        XCPU isn't used by SLURM at the moment, but it's a valid way
        to manually signal jobs using scancel or sbatch --signal.
