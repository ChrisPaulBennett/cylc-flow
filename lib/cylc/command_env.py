"""
Defines a string of scripting that sets CYLC_VERSION prior to sourcing
profile scripts. It is used at the top of task job scripts to give tasks
access to cylc on task hosts; and as the first part of event handler and
task poll and kill command strings, so that those commands also run
under the selected cylc version (event handlers may call cylc commands).
This allows users to run suites under multiple cylc versions at once, by 
setting their $PATH according to the cylc version number if necessary.
