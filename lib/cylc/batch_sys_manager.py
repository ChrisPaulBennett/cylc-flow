"""Manage submission, poll and kill of a job to the batch systems.

Export the symbol BATCH_SYS_MANAGER, which is the singleton object for the
BatchSysManager class.

Batch system handler (a.k.a. job submission method) modules should be placed
under the "cylc.batch_sys_handlers" package. Each module should export the
symbol "BATCH_SYS_HANDLER" for the singleton instance that implements the job
system handler logic.

Each batch system handler class should instantiate with no argument, and may
have the following constants and methods:

batch_sys.filter_poll_output(out, job_id) => boolean
    * If this method is available, it will be called after the batch system's
      poll command is called and returns zero. The method should read the
      output to see if job_id is still alive in the batch system, and return
      True if so. See also "batch_sys.POLL_CMD_TMPL".

batch_sys.filter_submit_output(out, err) => new_out, new_err
    * Filter the standard output and standard error of the job submission
      command. This is useful if the job submission command returns information
      that should just be ignored. See also "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL" and
      "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_TMPL".

batch_sys.get_fail_signals(job_conf) => list of strings
    * Return a list of names of signals to trap for reporting errors. Default
      is ["EXIT", "ERR", "TERM", "XCPU"]. ERR and EXIT are always recommended.
      EXIT is used to report premature stopping of the job script, and its trap
      is unset at the end of the script.

batch_sys.get_vacation_signal(job_conf) => str
    * If relevant, return a string containing the name of the signal that
      indicates the job has been vacated by the batch system.

batch_sys.format_directives(job_conf) => lines
    * If relevant, this method formats the job directives for a job file, if
      job file directives are relevant for the batch system. The argument
      "job_conf" is a dict containing the job configuration.

batch_sys.submit(job_file_path) => proc
    * Submit a job and return an instance of the Popen object for the
      submission. This method is useful if the job submission requires logic
      beyond just running a system or shell command. See also
      "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD".

batch_sys.CAN_KILL_PROC_GROUP
    * A boolean to indicate whether it is possible to kill the job by sending
      a signal to its Unix process group.

batch_sys.KILL_CMD_TMPL
    *  A Python string template for getting the batch system command to remove
       and terminate a job ID. The command is formed using the logic:
           batch_sys.KILL_CMD_TMPL % {"job_id": job_id}

batch_sys.POLL_CMD_TMPL
    * A Python string template for getting the batch system command to
      determine whether a job is alive, or to list jobs. The command is formed
      using the logic:
           batch_sys.POLL_CMD_TMPL % {"job_id": job_id}
      See also "batch_sys.filter_poll_output".

batch_sys.REC_ID_FROM_SUBMIT_ERR
batch_sys.REC_ID_FROM_SUBMIT_OUT
    * A regular expression (compiled) to extract the job "id" from the standard
      output or standard error of the job submission command.

batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL
    * A Python string template for getting the batch system command to submit a
      job file. The command is formed using the logic:
          batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL % {"job": job_file_path}
      See also "batch_sys.job_submit" and "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_TMPL".

batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_TMPL
    * The template string for getting the STDIN for the batch system command to
      submit a job file. The value to write to STDIN is formed using the logic:
          batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_TMPL % {"job": job_file_path}
      See also "batch_sys.job_submit" and "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD".

batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_IS_JOB_FILE
    * A boolean - iff True, use the contents of the job_file_path as stdin to
      the submit command.
      See also "batch_sys.job_submit", "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD", and
      "batch_sys.SUBMIT_CMD_STDIN_TMPL".
