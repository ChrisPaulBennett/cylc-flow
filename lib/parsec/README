PARSEC

A framework for constructing nested ini style config file specs with
automatic parsing, validation, default values, on-the-fly item
deprecation, and file combination (e.g. user.rc overrides site.rc
overrides defaults).

Used in cylc for:
 * suite definition files
 * gcylc config files
 * site/user config files

 How it works:
 * Parsec reads a nested config file and returns a corresponding nested
 dict, which can be upgraded (deprecation) on the fly, then validated
 against a file spec (a nested dict of the same form that specifies
 legal items and "validators" for their values).

Parsec config files support:
  * Jinja2
  * comments #
  * Line continuation
  * Trailing comments stripped
  * Single or double quotes
  * Triple-quoted multiline strings
  * String-internal comments retained
  * Validation against a spec module
  * Combining two config files (e.g. user.rc overrides site.rc)
NOT SUPPORTED:
  * Mixed quote types ( "foo' # ERROR! )

TODO -
 * A little special suite-definition-specific behaviour (combining
   identical graph sections) is encoded in the general parser - we need
   a way to specify this sort of thing in file-specific spec modules.
 * (low priority) move [runtime] inheritance out of cylc/config.py into 
   parsec and cylc/cfgspec/suite_spec.py.
