cylon systems (i.e. sets of related tasks to be controlled by cylon)
should be defined and maintained in their own repositories with version
tags to indicate which version of cylon they are compatible with. This
allows cylon development to continue without having to constantly
upgrade multiple task sets in the main repository.
