Example task definition files for cyclon. Task definitions based on
these templates are processed by task_generator.py, which
auto-generates the task class module (task_classes.py) used by cyclon.  

+ <task-name>.def
  task definition file, suitable for all normal tasks: those that
  have no prerequisites or trigger only off other cotemporal tasks, 
  and which don't need to override class methods to define special
  behaviour.

+ <task-name>.py
  verbatim python class code for tasks with complex behaviour that is
  not handled by task-generator.py
