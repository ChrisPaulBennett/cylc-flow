# AN EXAMPLE CYLC TASK DEFINITION FILE FOR A NON-FORECAST MODEL TASK
# (forecast models typically have special 'restart' prerequisites that
# are satisfied by outputs from a previous run of the same model). Most
# tasks in a typical system can be defined very simply, like this, but
# see full-template.def for complete task definition documentation.
