This is the simple system of tasks described in the cyclon documentation
paper, with a few modifications. 

It can be run in real mode or dummy mode.  In real mode, the real task
scripts "write output files" by creating zero-sized files in the temp
directory, and "read input files" by checking for the existence of the 
expected files.

In real mode, the correct run time is simulated using the unix 'sleep'
command, but accelerated so that 10 sec = 1 hour for quick completion.
It can be run in dummy mode using the same time acceleration, for
comparison.
