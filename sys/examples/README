simple-0
========
This is the simple example system described in the cyclon documentation
paper, with an additional oneoff 'startup' task that provides initital
restart input to the forecast models (A,B,C) and cleans out the work
space for the system in real mode.  The external tasks, located in the
scripts sub-directory, are 'unmodified' in that they do not know about
cyclon. Cyclon runs them via its task wrapping mechanism, and all tasks
necessarily depend on their upstream dependers finishing (actually, they
can depend on defined internal outputs of the upstream tasks, but the
task-wrapper can only set these completed when the task has finished).
Note also that forecast model tasks are still aware of restart
prerequisites and outputs, even in a wrapped system case, but that any
restart outputs can only be set completed when the task finishes.

simple-1
========
This is a slightly more realistic system, although still task-wrapped: 
 * an additional oneoff cold-start task provides initial restart inputs
   for the forecast models at system startup.
 * an additional task gets external input for the system (in simple-0 this
functionality is part of task A)

simple-2
========
In this system the external tasks have been modified so that cyclon can
run them directly without using the task wrapping mechanism: the tasks
send their own 'started', 'finished', 'failed', and output messages when
appropriate. Thus:
 * tasks can depend on internal outputs from upstream dependers, instead
   of waiting for them to finish.
 * tasks could be switched in and out of the system at will (e.g.
   replacing one forecast model with another) so long as they provide
   the same outputs.

Simple-2 also includes a 'dummy task' that uses cyclon's external dummy
task program to simulate the defined outputs even in real mode. This can
be used to "provide initial restart inputs" for forecast models that are
in reality provided by external means (e.g. a spinup experiment) prior to
starting cyclon. We don't do this in the simple examples, however,
because their real tasks do require these restart inputs, but we haven't
provided a standalone external means of providing them.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLE SYSTEMS
===========================

These simple example systems can be run real mode or dummy mode.  

In real mode, the real task scripts "write output files" by creating
zero-sized files in the temp directory, and "read input files" by
checking for the existence of the expected files. Also, task run
time is simulated using the unix 'sleep' command, but accelerated so
that 10 sec = 1 hour for quick completion. 

In dummy mode, cyclon runs external dummy programs that simulate the
real tasks by reporting each of the registered outputs completed at the
right time. This can be done using the same time 10s = 1hr time
acceleration for comparison with real mode runs.
