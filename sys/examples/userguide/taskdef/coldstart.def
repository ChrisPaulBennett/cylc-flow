# THIS IS A CYLC TASK DEFINITION FILE

%NAME
    coldstart

%DESCRIPTION
    Provides the initial restart prerequisites for the forecast models
    (A, B, and C). In a real system there should be a separate cold start
    task for each model, and any model that is "spun up" by external
    means before starting the system would have a dummy cold start task
    to satisfy the corresponding prerequisites.
    Depends on the system startup task.
