# THIS IS A CYLC TASK DEFINITION FILE

%NAME
    system_cold_start, cold

%DESCRIPTION
    Provides the initial restart prerequisites for the tasks forecast
    models (A, B, and C). In a real system, there would be a separate
    cold start task for each model, and any model that is "spun up" by
    external means would have a dummy cold start task.
    Depends on the system startup task.
