%TASK
    coldstart, cld

%DESCRIPTION
    Userguide Example Suite: a oneoff coldstart task that provides the
    initial restart prerequisites for the forecast models. A real system
    would likely have distinct cold start tasks for each forecast model.

%TYPE
    free, oneoff

%HOURS
    0,6,12,18

%COMMAND
    coldstart.sh

%COLDSTART_PREREQUISITES
    # depend on the startup task only at start time (we may want to
    # insert this task later, when the startup task is long gone, as
    # part of a failure recovery scenario).
    "startup%$(CYCLE_TIME) finished"

%OUTPUTS
    "A restart files ready for $(CYCLE_TIME)"
    "B restart files ready for $(CYCLE_TIME)"
    "C restart files ready for $(CYCLE_TIME)"
