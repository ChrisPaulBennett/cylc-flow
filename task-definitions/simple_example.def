# THIS IS A SEQUENZ TASK CLASS DEFINITION FILE

# SIMPLE EXAMPLE: a task with cotemporal prerequisites (i.e. it is
# triggered only off other tasks running with the same reference time)
# and whose only downstream dependents (i.e. other tasks triggered by
# this task's outputs) are also cotemporal.

# See full_template.def for more documentation of each entry
