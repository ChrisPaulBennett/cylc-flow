Processes that could potentially run in parallel should clearly be done in
different tasks, but should processes that are necessarily connected and
sequential (e.g. retrieval of a file and subsequent format conversion) be done
in different tasks? 

Cyclon can easily handle a large number of tasks, so there are definite
advantages to fine-graining the system:

 * a more modular and transparent system
 * in case of failure it is easy to re-run just the part that failed
 * the same external script (e.g. for file retrieval) can often be invoked,
   (with different args via %EXPORT), for multiple system tasks.
