Processes that could run in parallel (or at least overlap) if the opportunity
arises (i.e. prerequisites allowing) should clearly be done by different
tasks, but should processes that are necessarily connected and sequential
(e.g. retrieval of a file and subsequent format conversion) be done in
different tasks? 

Cyclon can easily handle a large number of tasks, so there are definite
advantages to fine-graining the system:

 * a more modular and transparent system
 * in case of failure it is easy to re-run just the part that failed
 * the same external script (e.g. for file retrieval) can often be invoked,
   (with different args via %EXPORT), for multiple system tasks.
