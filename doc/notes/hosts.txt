In principle, cylc suites can be monitored and controlled from a remote
host, using a --host=HOST option to all commands that act through a 
pyro server. However, the user interface currently does not allow this,
except in the case of the passive commands,
    - scan
    - ping
    - dump
    - monitor
    - show
for the following reasons:

1/ we need to put some thought into suite security when it comes to
   intervening in suites running on remote hosts. Does it matter if the
   owner's username is different on the two hosts?  Use of a secure
   passphrase is probably sufficient, but what about suites that don't
   use a secure passphrase?

2/ Some commands get information via non-pyro means.  E.g. (i) the suite
   registration databases are currently implemented as local files
   without access via a Pyro server. (ii) The gcylc suite control gui
   needs to read the suite log files, task job submission files, and
   task stdout and stderr files, which all reside on the suite host.
