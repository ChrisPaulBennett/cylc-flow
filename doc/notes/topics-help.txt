Cylc commands allow only the suite owner to intervene in a running suite.

The cylc lockserver prevents accidental simultaneous runs of the same
suite (unless the suite allows it) even if it is registered under
several names, or of the same task at the same cycle time (even by
single task submit).

Suite blocking guards against inadvertent intervention in your own suites,
but it can be annoying so it is disabled by default. To turn blocking on:
 + SUITE.RC: use suite blocking = True

A secure passphrase prevents other users from accessing your suite even
if they hack command source code to subvert the owner-only restriction.
 + SUITE.RC: use secure passphrase = True
The passphrase must be stored in $HOME/.cylc/security/[SUITE_NAME] with
private file permissions, or cylc will refuse to run the suite. If your
suite contains tasks that run on a remote host or under another
username, those accounts must also hold the passphrase. The passphrase
is never sent across the network; a secure md5 checksum is exchanged."""

topic_help[ 'gui' ] = """
The cylc Graphical User Interface is 'gcylc'. It starts an app from
which you can manage suite registrations and choose which suites to
edit, graph, or run, etc., or direct suite control apps for particular
suites.  For help, see the GUI 'help' menu items and buttons."""

topic_help[ 'alerting' ] = """
Cylc can call a designated alert script on any of the following events:
 + a task is submitted
 + a task fails to submit
 + a task times out in job submission
 + a task starts running
 + a task finishes successfully
 + a task fails to finish successfully
 + a task times out in execution.

Alert scripts can be configured for the suite as a whole and/or on a per
task basis. This can be used to send an email or an SMS to operation
support staff, update task status in a dedicated monitoring system such
as Nagios, or whatever you like. See suite config (suite.rc)
documentation for configuration details."""

topic_help['registration'] = """
A cylc suite must be registered in your local (user-specific)
registration database before you can use it. This associates a name
with the suite definition directory so that you can target the suite by
name when you run it and so on. In addition, suite names can be
organized into groups, for example:
    foo
    nwp:oper1
    nwp:oper2
    test:a
Suite names without a group prefix are implicitly in the 'default' group.

Registered suites can also be exported to, or imported from, the central
suite database, to enable easy sharing of suites between users.

Access to the central database is currently local to the cylc host
machine; the database is read anew each time it is accessed, and any
transactions that change it acquire a database lock that prevents any
other non-readonly access for the very short time between data load and
unload. In the future we may use database server akin to the cylc
lockserver that can serve suites across the network and will not require
locking."""
