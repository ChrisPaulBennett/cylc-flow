Dummying Out Tasks:

VIA TASKDEF FILE:
The "dummy" task type modifier is no longer implemented as an actual
type modifier like "contact" etc. Instead, the task class generator just
replaces the specified external task with /bin/true in the generated
task class definition. Thus every instance created will be dummied out
until the taskdef is modified to un-dummy it and suite is reconfigured.

VIA THE SUITE RC FILE:
In order to have the same effect as above, this is implemented as follows:
When tasks are loaded at startup, if they appear in the suite.rc dummy list 
the external task is replaced with /bin/true in the task instance *and* 
a task class variable "dummy_me_out" is set so that subsequent successors
to the instance will dummy themselves out at creation time. This works
for cold and warm starts, and restarts, because the suite.rc dummy list
is checked in both cases.
