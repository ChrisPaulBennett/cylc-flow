Registration serves two purposes: (1) cylc commands that need to access
system-specific modules can do so without the user having to type the
full system definition directory path on the command line; and (2) the
registered name is used, along with your username, to distinguish
between different systems using the Pyro nameserver at the same time. 

A system's registered name is made available to tis tasks via their
execution environment, as \lstinline=$SYSTEM_NAME=. If all tasks are
configured to use the name in all important input and output filepaths,
then it is possible to run multiple instances of the system at the same
time without any interference between them. The userguide example system
is capable of this.
