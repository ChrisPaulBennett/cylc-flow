You can reset a task to {\em finished} (i.e.\ completed outputs) if you
know that the external task has completed successfully prior to starting
the scheduler, or by some external means 
(e.g. use of \lstinline=cylc submit=).

Similarly, you can reset a task to {\em ready} (i.e.\ satisfied
prerequisites) if you know that the task's prerequisites have been
satisfied by some external means.  Generally this is functionally
equivalent to resetting the task to {\em waiting} (i.e.\ waiting for its
prerequisites to be satisfied) {\em unless} the tasks responsible for
satisfying those prerequisites are no longer present in the task pool.
