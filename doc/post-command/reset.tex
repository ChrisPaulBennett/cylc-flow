You can reset a task to {\em finished} (i.e.\ completed outputs) if you
know that the external task has completed successfully prior to starting
the scheduler, or by some external means (e.g. use of
\lstinline=cylc run-task=).

Similarly, resetting a task to {\em ready} (i.e.\ satisfied
prerequisites) can be done if you know that the task's prerequisites
have been satisfied by some external means, perhaps prior to starting
the system.  If you are dealing with a failed task that has been fixed,
doing this is functionally equivalent to resetting the task to {\em
waiting} (i.e.\ waiting for its prerequisites to be satisfied) {\em
unless} the tasks responsible for satisfying those prerequisites are no
longer present in the task pool (this should not happen!).
