Default versions of the customizable files are generated the first time
a system is configured. Currently they are raw Python source modules,
but they are very simple and it should be reasonably obvious, by
inspection, how to modify them (if you are not a Python programmer, be
aware that indentation is important in Python).  If you wish to revert
to default customizable config files, delete or rename your customized
files before reconfiguring.

Any customized configuration files should be added to you system's
revision control repository, particularly if the customizations
therein are critical to the running of the system (e.g.\ the
\lstinline=$CYLC_TMPDIR= environment variable in the userguide example
system).
