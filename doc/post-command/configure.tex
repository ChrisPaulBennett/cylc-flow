Default versions of the customizable files are generated the first time
a system is configured. Currently they are raw Python source modules,
but they are very simple and how to modify them should be reasonably
obvious by inspection (if you are not a Python programmer, be aware that
indentation is important in Python).  If you wish to revert to default
customizable config files, delete or rename your customized files before
reconfiguring.

It is recommended that customized configuration modules are added the
system's revision control repository if any of the customizations are
critically important to the system (the \lstinline=$CYLC_TMPDIR=
environment variable in the cylc example systems are in this category.
