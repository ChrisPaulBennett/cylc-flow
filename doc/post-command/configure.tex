Default versions of the customizable files are generated the first time
a system is configured. Currently they are raw Python source modules,
but they are very simple and how to modify them should be reasonably
obvious by inspection (if you are not a Python programmer, be aware that
indentation is important in Python).  If you wish to revert to default
customizable config files, delete or rename your customized files before
reconfiguring.

Any customized configuration files should be added to you system's
revision control repository, particularly if any of the customizations
are critically important to running of the system (e.g.\ the
\lstinline=$CYLC_TMPDIR= environment variable in the userguide example
system).
