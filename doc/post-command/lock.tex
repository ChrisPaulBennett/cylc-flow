Prevention of non-owners from interfering with a running system (by
unlocking it to allow further intervention, for instance) is achieved
via a simple comparison of usernames determined at startup, in the
scheduler and in the other commands. It would not be difficult for a
malicious user to get around this block by modifying command source code
slightly.

Note also that by default anyone with access to the \lstinline=pyro-nsc=
command can shut down the Pyro nameserver or delete objects from it. 

If it is deemed necessary, in the future, we may replace this simple
security mechanism with some kind of hard authentication, perhaps by way
of Pyro's security features.
