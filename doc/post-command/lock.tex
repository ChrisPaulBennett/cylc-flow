Prevention of non-owners from interfering in a running system (unlocking
it to allow further intervention, for instance) is achieved via a simple
comparison of usernames determined at startup, in the scheduler and in
the other commands. It would not be difficult for a malicious user
to subvert this mechanism by modifying the source code a little. 

Note also that by default anyone with access to the 'pyro-nsc' command
can shut down the Pyro nameserver or delete object groups from it. 

If it is deemed necessary, in the future, we may replace this simple
security mechanism with some kind of hard authentication, perhaps using
Pyro's security features.
