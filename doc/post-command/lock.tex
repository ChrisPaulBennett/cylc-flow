Non-owners are prevented from interfering with a running system by a
simple comparison of usernames; it would not be difficult for a
malicious user to get around this by altering some cylc source code.
Note also that by default anyone with access to the \lstinline=pyro-nsc=
command can shut down the Pyro nameserver or delete objects from it. If
it is deemed necessary, in the future, we may replace this simple
security mechanism with some kind of hard authentication, perhaps by way
of Pyro's security features.
