Purge can only detect downstream dependencies of the targetted task in
task proxies that actually exist at the time the command is used. So
unless you really know what you're doing {\em do not purge a task whose
downstream dependants do not all exist yet} (presumably because *their*
predecessors in earlier cycles have not spawned yet).  If you do do
this, you may need to clean up later with some manual use of 
\lstinline=cylc kill=.
