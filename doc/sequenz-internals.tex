\title{An Optimal Dynamic Metascheduler for Continuously Cycling
Multi-Model Forecasting Systems}

\author{Hilary Oliver, NIWA}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} A metascheduler is a control system that determines
    when members of a set of tasks with dependencies are {\em ready} to
    be scheduled for execution.* This paper describes a flexible
    metascheduling algorithm that provides optimal control over
    continuously cycling multi-model environmental forecasting systems
    without prescribing task execution order or requiring that
    dependencies between tasks be explicitly defined. Each task simply
    registers its own prerequisites, without reference to other tasks in
    the system, and dependencies are negotiated dynamically as outputs
    are reported so that correct execution order emerges naturally at
    run time.  The algorithm is optimal in the sense that tasks are
    queued for execution at the instant their prerequisites are
    satisfied regardless of associated forecast cycle or any other
    consideration. Tasks from many different forecast cycles can
    therefore run simultaneously, where dependencies allow, to achieve
    maximum throughput during catch up to real time after delays or when
    running the entire system over historical case study periods. The
    absence of any task-specific sequencing logic or predefined
    dependencies gives great flexibility: tasks can be switched on and
    off on the fly, new tasks can be added without altering the main
    program, and parallel test systems that feed off the main operation,
    or entirely new systems, can be built quickly.  Our dynamic
    metascheduler, {\em sequenz}, is easily interfaced to existing tasks
    (models etc.). It is written in the Python language and uses the
    Python Remote Object protocol ({\em Pyro}) to control tasks on
    multiple platforms at once. 

*The term can also refer to {\it a single aggregate view of multiple
Distributed Resource Managers}, which is not the topic of this paper.

\section{Cycling Multi-Model Forecasting Systems}

Continuously cycling multi-model environmental forecasting operations
generate forecast products at regular intervals using a set of connected
scientific models and associated data processing tasks\footnote{A {\em
task} is any group of processes treated as a single entity for
scheduling purposes.} driven by real time observational data and/or forecast
fields from another operation.  The EcoConnect Forecasting System at the
National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New
Zealand takes real time atmospheric and stream flow observations, and
operational global weather forecasts from the UK Met Office, and uses
these to drive global sea state and regional data assimilating weather
models, which in turn drive regional sea state, storm surge, and
catchment river models, plus tide prediction, and a large number of
associated tasks for data collection, quality control, preprocessing,
postprocessing, product generation, and archiving.\footnote{Plans for
EcoConnect include additional deterministic regional weather models and
a statistical ensemble of weather models.}  In real time operation, the
arrival of new external driving data initiates a new {\em forecast
cycle} consisting of a group of tasks with a common {\em forecast
reference time}, the nominal start time of the new model forecasts. Not
all tasks necessarily run in every cycle. The regional weather model in
EcoConnect, for instance, runs four times daily in the 00, 06, 12, and
18 UTC cycles, but it supplies surface pressures to a regional storm
surge model that runs only twice daily, in the 00 and 12 UTC cycles, and
precipitation accumulations to catchment river models that run on an
hourly cycle as they assimilate real time stream flow observations. 

\section{Control Systems}

Control systems for forecasting operations must carefully manage task
scheduling to achieve good system throughput without attempting to
execute any task before its prerequisites have been satisfied by the
other tasks in the system. This is relatively straightforward to arrange
for normal real time operation, where consecutive forecast cycles are
separated by a time gap as the system waits on new external driving
data. But it is very difficult, because of intercycle dependencies, to
exploit the potential for simultaneous execution of tasks from different
forecast cycles that exists when the external driving data is available
in advance. This is a serious problem for operations that, because of
hardware limitations, have little down time between cycles and thus take
dramatically longer than necessary to catch up to real time after
delays. The ability to run tasks from many different forecast cycles at
once, where dependencies allow, is also extremely useful for parallel
test systems that must slowly catch up to a main operation, for running
the entire system (or part thereof) over historical case study periods,
and sometimes even during real time operation: see the EcoConnect
catchment model's unusual mode of operation, below.


\subsection{Existing Systems}

It is natural to think about forecasting systems on a per cycle basis
because they normally operate as a linear sequence of complete forecast
cycles separated by a time gap (as the system waits on new external
driving data in real time). 
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=4cm]{dependencies-one}
    \end{center}
    \caption{\small Dependency diagram for a single forecast cycle
    in a simple example system. Tasks $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent
    different forecast models, and $d$, $e$ and $f$ post processing or
    product generation tasks.}
    \label{fig-dep-one}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig-dep-one} shows the task dependency diagram for a single
cycle of a simple example system, which forms a {\em Directed
Acyclic Graph}. The graph is actually incomplete because it does not
show the intercycle dependencies that exist, at the least, between
consecutive runs of each forecast model (each new forecast starts from a
{\em background model state} generated by the previous forecast). But
if one cycle always completes before the next starts then any intercycle
dependencies are implicitly satisfied and can be ignored. In any
case, according to the diagram, each task may depend upon one or more
other upstream tasks, and one or more other downstream tasks may in turn
depend on it. A control system could therefore allow multiple parallel
streams of execution that branch when one task generates output for
several downstream tasks, and merge when one task takes input from
several upstream tasks. 
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{timeline-one}
    \end{center}
    \caption{\small Optimal job schedule for two consecutive cycles of
    the example system of Figure \ref{fig-dep-one}, given the
    arbitrarily chosen execution times represented by the horizontal
    extent of the task bars, and assuming that downstream tasks depend
    on upstream tasks {\em finishing} rather than on intermediate
    outputs.} 
    \label{fig-time-one}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig-time-one} shows the optimal job schedule for two
consecutive cycles of the example system, given the arbitrarily chosen
execution times represented by the horizontal extent of the task bars,
and assuming that downstream tasks depend on upstream tasks {\em
finishing} rather than on intermediate outputs.  The schedule is optimal in
the sense that each task begins executing at the earliest possible time,
i.e.\ as soon as all of its prerequisites have been satisfied by the
other tasks in the system. In practice this means tasks will be queued
for execution at the earliest possible time; whether they actually run
immediately is up to the batch queue scheduler(s), but we can assume
they will run immediately for the purposes of this paper. A vertical
section through the graph intersects all tasks executing in parallel
at the time, but the vertical ordering of tasks is not meaningful.

The simplest control system that could manage this might be one that
runs tasks in order from an externally defined list, perhaps providing
some mechanism for the user to specify tasks that can run in parallel.
Then, arguably, the obvious step up in sophistication is a Finite State
Machine that enforces a predetermined non-linear execution schedule
defined by the single cycle dependency graph for the system: {\em IF
task $b$ has finished AND task $c$ has finished THEN begin executing
task $d$}, etc.  Both of these designs are easy to comprehend and
reasonably straightforward to implement\footnote{We have glossed over
many implementation details here that are highly non-trivial, but they
are nevertheless irrelevant to the high level metascheduling algorithm.}
and, as far as the author is aware, most existing operational forecast
control systems are variations on one or the other (it is difficult to
be sure of this, however, because they are invariably system-specific
in-house projects that are not documented in the
literature!).\footnote{DAGMan, which is part of the Condor distributed
workload management system [REF:...], is a generic metascheduler for
sets of jobs with dependencies, but it does not appear to allow the kind
of continuously dependent system described in this paper.}

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

The first of the two basic designs above is quite flexible in that
specific tasks are not hard coded into the main program, but it relies
on the user to define which tasks can run in parallel, probably by
primitive means, and is unlikely to be capable of approaching the
optimal single cycle job schedule for a realistic system. The Finite
State Machine on the other hand, can be deliberately designed to follow
the optimal single cycle job schedule for its particular hard coded task
set. Unfortunately though, this is highly system-specific, and hard
coded finite state logic becomes increasingly convoluted as system
complexity increases, which leads to inflexibility and fragility
(consider adding a new task with dependencies into an existing system).
Also, as explained earlier, when the external driving data is available
in advance we would like to be able to run tasks from many different
forecast cycles at once, where dependencies allow, but this cannot be
done if intercycle dependencies have been ignored (implying strict
sequential cycling). The additional task sequencing logic needed to fix
this within the confines of a Finite State Machine would be
prohibitively complicated, if not impossible, for any realistic system.


\subsection{A New Approach} 

NIWA's EcoConnect operation, which motivated this work, was sufficiently
complex and computationally intensive on current hardware to warrant
development of a more flexible control system that could also interleave
successive cycles for efficient catchup operation.  To do this we have
to abandon the concept of a linear sequence of global forecast cycles,
as far as the control system is concerned, and instead take proper
account of {\em all} dependencies regardless of forecast cycle. 
\begin{figure} \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{dependencies-two} \end{center}
    \caption{\small Dependency graph for two consecutive cycles of our
    simple example system, with the least possible intercycle
    dependence: each of the tasks that represent forecast models ($a$,
    $b$, and $c$) depends on its own previous instance for the initial
    ``background model state''.} 
    \label{fig-dep-two}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig-dep-two} shows the dependency graph for two consecutive
cycles of our example system, with the least possible intercycle
dependence: each of the tasks that represent forecast models ($a$, $b$,
and $c$) depends on its own previous instance for the initial
``background model state''.  This is sufficient to demonstrate global
optimal metascheduling, but note that Figure \ref{fig-dep-two} is now
inextricably connected, via intercycle dependencies, to previous and
subsequent cycles, and that real systems can also include intercycle
dependencies that link different task types and span more than one
forecast cycle (c.f.\ the EcoConnect catchment model's dependence on the
regional weather model, as described above). 

Figure \ref{fig-time-two} shows the optimal task schedule for the
example system, updated for the dependencies of Figure
\ref{fig-dep-two}, when the external driving data is available in
advance (for catchup operation, etc., as explained above).
\begin{figure} 
    \begin{center} 
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{timeline-two}
    \end{center} 
    \caption{\small Optimal job schedule for several consecutive cycles
    of our example system, with dependencies as shown in Figure
    \ref{fig-dep-one} and all external driving data available.} 
    \label{fig-time-two}
\end{figure} 
The initial task $a$, which has no dependence on cotemporal (same
reference time) upstream tasks, can run continuously regardless of how
much downstream processing is yet to be completed in any previous cycle.
This is good because the initial forecast task is normally a resource
intensive atmosphere or ocean model (in fact there may be two or more
such initial tasks that can both run continuously, in parallel). In
practice the initial tasks would actually depend on cotemporal upstream
tasks that wait on the external driving data, but this does not change
the result because data collection tasks return immediately when their
data is already available. The other tasks can repeat at regular short
intervals, for which the interval gap is the difference between their
own run length and the maximum length of any cotemporal upstream
execution paths that they depend on. Thus Task $c$ runs continuously,
and consecutive instances of task $e$ can actually overlap to a
significant degree. At any one time tasks from three different cycles
can run simultaneously, even for this very simple system, and efficiency
is clearly far in advance of the sequential cycling schedule of Figure
\ref{fig-time-one} (for which the time gap between the two cycles should
be shrunk to zero, for comparison). 

In the following sections we describe a new algorithm that achieves
continuous optimal metascheduling as shown in Figure \ref{fig-time-two}.
As the system catches up to real time and is again constrained by
availability of the external driving data it smoothly transitions to a
linear sequence of distinct cycles, as in Figure \ref{fig-time-one}. In
contrast to Finite State Machine controllers, the new method is
completely generic (i.e.\ not system-specific), extremely flexible, and
widely applicable.  


\section{Object Oriented Dynamic Metascheduling}

As discussed, the concept of a global ``forecast cycle'' has to be
replaced with a distinct ``forecast reference time'' for each task, and
all dependencies handled properly regardless of reference time. This
suggests the possibility of an object oriented design in which members
of an evolving group of self contained task proxy objects, each with
their own reference time and each reflecting the state of the external
tasks they represent, interact with each other to negotiate dependencies
at run time.  The flexibility of this approach is self-evident, if it
can be made to work.  Dynamic negotiation of dependencies means there is
absolutely no need for hardwired system-specific task sequencing logic,
and by means of object polymorphism\footnote{Polymorphism is the ability
of one type to appear as and be used like another type. In OOP languages
with inheritance, this usually refers to the ability to treat derived
class objects as if they were members of a base class so that, for
instance, a group of mixed-type objects can all be treated as members of
a common base class while retaining their specialized derived class
behaviour.} a control system can be designed that will, without
modification, automatically handle any new task that is derived from
(inherits the properties of) the original task base class.  The new
control system, as described below, is implemented the object oriented
scripting language, Python.

\subsection{Task Proxy Objects}

blah\dots

\label{sec-task-messaging}
\subsection{Communicating with Real Tasks}

The internal state of our task proxy objects must accurately reflect the
progress of their real external counterparts.  There is a temptation to
try track external task progress by watching for the appearance of
critical output files, because most task prerequisites are just files
generated by other tasks. But we have to be sure that a newly detected
file is complete, not just that it exists, which is difficult to do in
general.  On Linux one could insist that every completed output file is
immediately renamed by the generating task, and have the controller use
{\em inotify} to watch for the sudden appearance of the new file
(because file rename operations are atomic when the source and target
are on the same file system) [REF: Simon, if he wants]. But this is not
platform independent, and most forecast systems run on heterogeneous
distributed hardware. More importantly though, prerequisites are not
necessarily single files: tasks could conceivably depend on completion
of a large sets of files, database updates, or a data transfers by
remote procedure call, for instance. Consequently we chose to use a high
level messaging system for communication between external tasks and the
control system. This is entirely platform independent and allows tasks
to be triggered off any conceivable condition. In the case of a file
prerequisite, for example, rather than detecting the existence of the
real file, the controller receives a message saying ``file foo is
ready'', or similar, from the task that has just generated the file.

The Python Remote Object Protocal (Pyro) allows external programs to
communicate directly, across the network, with specific objects inside
the running controller. This means that tasks can communicate directly
with their own proxy objects, obviating the need for any any internal
message brokering mechanism in the control system.    

Each task must express its prerequisites (i.e.\ its dependence on
upstream tasks) as a text string, for example ``file X is ready'', or
``task X has completed'', or ``task X has completed writing all Y
files'', and must send messages of the same kind back to the controller
to indicate when it has reached an important waypoint or completed
generated any important outputs.  


\begin{comment}

there are several kinds of non-cotemporal (different reference time)
dependence.  Forecast models depend on their own previous instance,
because one forecast generates the {\em background model state} for the
next.  In addition, some forecast models may depend explicitly on
earlier tasks of a different type, as well as on their own previous
instance.  Post processing tasks, on the other
hand, do not depend on their own previous instance, strictly speaking,
but they depend on cotemporal forecast models that do. EcoConnect's
hourly river flow forecasts, for example, take input from the most
recent previous regional weather forecast.  Finally, some tasks, such as
those that wait on external input data, and tide models, may have no
upstream dependencies at all.

Non-forecast model tasks can even overlap with their own previous
instances, if the opportunity arises (this occurs when a post processing
task takes longer to run than the delay between its upstream model
starting and it starting).  System throughput can be greatly increased
by allowing tasks from many different forecast cycles to run
simultaneously where dependencies allow.

This could be done by checking for the existence of required inputs
directly, or by monitoring the state of the other tasks that are known
to provide the inputs in each case (are they finished yet?).  

\subsection{Dynamic Metascheduling}

knows its own prerequisites (inputs) and outputs, and can interact
with other tasks to negotiate dependencies so that correct sequencing
emerges naturally at run time.  The entire sequencing problem is now
contained within the task interaction step, which is almost trivial
because it is completely indiscriminate: whenever any task changes
state, {\em each task} asks {\em all the others} if they can satisfy its
prerequisites with their completed outputs (it does not matter that most
of these interactions are destined to be fruitless). The control program
thus remains simple and generic, regardless of the number of tasks or
the complexity of their interdependencies; it simply manages a set of
tasks that are all individually configured as if they were to run in
isolation.\footnote{The system manager does of course have to ensure
that the configured task pool is self consistent, i.e.\ that each task's
prerequisites will be satisfied by some other task(s) in the system.}
The total absence of explicit sequencing logic makes this method
extremely flexible and extensible.\footnote{To extend the system, one
simply derives a new class definition that lists the new task's
prerequisites and outputs. The new task will automatically run at the
right time, i.e.\ when its prerequisites have been satisfied by some
other task(s) in the system.}

Dynamic sequencing can be viewed as a simulation of an interacting task
set in which the state of each {\em simulee} is tied to, and can
influence, that of the real task it represents.  This suggests a
powerful dummy mode of operation in which the simulation is divorced
from reality by replacing external tasks with an external dummy program
that masquerades as a real task by ``completing'' each of its outputs in
turn (i.e.\ it reports they are complete because, as far as the
controller is concerned, task outputs are just {\em messages}; more on
this below).  The control program cannot distinguish this from real
operations, so the dummy mode allows complete testing of the control
system for a given configured task set, without running any real tasks.


\subsection{{\em Sequenz}}

A dynamic sequencing controller would clearly be most naturally
implemented in an object oriented programming language, which provides
the tools for object construction and interaction.  We must also provide
the means for task objects to launch their external tasks when their
prerequisites are satisfied (e.g.\  by submission to a batch queue
scheduler on a task-dependent target machine), and for synchronization
of the internal states of task objects and the external tasks they
represent, via remote method calls or something similar.  Finally, the
generic description above assumes that task objects exist whenever they
are needed (for external task control and for interacting with other
dependent tasks), so we must devise a task management scheme governing
the creation and destruction of task objects, to ensure that this is the
case.

NIWA's EcoConnect Forecasting System, described above, is controlled by
an asynchronous dynamic sequencing implementation called {\em Sequenz},
implemented in object oriented Python and using the Python Remote Object
protocol ({\em Pyro}) for direct network communication between task
objects and the tasks they represent. It allows tasks from many
different forecast cycles to run at once, where dependencies allow,
transitions seamlessly from ``catchup'' or case study mode (where all
external input is available from the outset and much asynchronous
activity is therefore possible, e.g.\ after system downtime; in this
case) to normal real time operation, tasks can be switched on and off
while the controller is running, new tasks added without any change to
the main program, and the system can be restarted in arbitrarily complex
states after downtime.  It also features the powerful dummy mode
described above, for testing, and allows easy construction of ad hoc
parallel test systems feeding off the main operational system. Pyro also
enables efficient RPC-based remote control and system monitoring by
external programs.  Sequenz can be interfaced to existing models and
tasks with minimal overhead. 

The operation runs on heterogenous distributed
hardware, which includes a massively parallel supercomputer and several
Linux servers. 

\subsubsection{Applicability}

The dynamic sequencing concept is very general and could in principle be
implemented for any set of interdependent tasks. Sequenz, however, is
somewhat specialized toward cycling forecast systems, such as
EcoConnect, in which each task has an associated {\em reference time}
(generally the nominal forecast start time, or {\em analysis} time, of
the associated forecast model) that all task prerequisites and outputs
depend on in some way. and a set of valid times for each task type (e.g.\
the atmospheric model might run at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC each day,
while the river model runs hourly).  One-off task pools with no
particular time dependence, however, are much simpler than this, and it
would not be difficult to strip all reference time handling from the
program.

In addition, EcoConnect operates in a well defined environment so that,
for example, each task knows exactly what its input files look like
(filenaming conventions) and where to get them from (e.g.\ {\em task X}'s
output directory). Consequently, for file-based prerequisites, the
controller does not need to know the file's actual location or check for
its existence, because the external tasks already do that. It could,
however, easily be made to pass file locations between tasks so that all
input/output filenames and paths could be defined centrally in the
control program itself.  


\subsection{Alternatives}

As far as the author is aware, there are currently no other systems
available that can do general {\em asynchronous} sequencing, as
described in this paper.

In the planning stage, in addition to considering a Finite State Machine
design, as discussed above, we also considered new generation batch
queue schedulers (which now allow simple job dependencies), and use of
some kind of generic control framework.  Schedulers are still too
rudimentary for our purposes, however, and no generic control framework
that was obviously well suited came to light. In any case, the dynamic
sequencing design described in this paper simplifies the problem to such
an extent that it is unlikely any generic framework could compete.  


\section{Implementation}

To implement dynamic sequencing we need a specific {\em task management}
scheme that controls when tasks will be created and destroyed, and so
on. There are many options here; for instance: should tasks be created
all at once, in cotemporal batches, or one at a time as their
predecessors finish? The consequences of these choices must be evaluated
carefully, which isn't easy in light of the inherent complexity of
asynchronous operation. At the simpler end of the task management
spectrum we could, for example, create a whole month's worth of tasks at
once and let them interact until everything runs to completion.  Nothing
would run out of sequence, {\em but} system monitoring would be
difficult because of the sheer number of tasks involved, the end of the
month would present an artificial barrier to operations, tasks that lack
prerequisites would all want to run at once, and system restarts would
be overly complicated. 

\subsection{Main Algorithm}

The algorithm below operates on a single pool of interacting task
objects, has simple start up and continuous operation, and is relatively
easy to monitor (task objects exist by the time they are needed but not
for too long before that, and not for too long after they are finished). 

The simplicity of the dynamic sequencing algorithm is clear from the
following code listing, taken directly from the main program:

{\small
\noindent
\rule{5cm}{.2mm}
\begin{lstlisting}
# (startup initialization code omitted)

while True: # MAIN LOOP

   if task_base.state_changed:
       # PROCESS ALL TASKS whenever one has changed state
       # as a result of a remote task message coming in: 
       # interact, run, create new, and kill spent tasks
       #---
       task_pool.process_tasks()
       task_pool.dump_state()
       if task_pool.all_finished():
           clean_shutdown( "ALL TASKS FINISHED" )

    # REMOTE METHOD HANDLING; handleRequests() returns 
    # after one or more remote method invocations are 
    # processed (these are not just task messages, hence 
    # the use of task_base.state_changed above).
    #---
    task_base.state_changed = False
    pyro_daemon.handleRequests( timeout = None )

# END MAIN LOOP
\end{lstlisting}
}

\subsection{Details}

\subsubsection{Startup and Initialization}

An initial reference time and list of task object names are read in from
the config file, then each task object is created at the initial
reference time {\em or} at the first subsequent reference time that is
valid for the task type. Optionally, we can tell the controller to
reload the current state dump file (which may have been edited); this
will override the configured start time and task list. After startup,
new tasks are created only by {\em abdication} (below).

An initial run through the {\em task processing} code, by virtue of the
fact that the main loop starts with task processing, causes tasks with
no prerequisites (e.g.\ {\em downloader}) to enter the {\em running}
state and launch their external tasks immediately. Otherwise ({\em or}
if there are no tasks that lack prerequisites) nothing will happen.



\subsubsection{Creation of New Tasks}

New tasks are created by abdication, i.e.\ create $foo(T\negmedspace
+\negmedspace 1)$ if $foo(T)$ is {\em finished}.  Task abdication
ensures that $foo(T\negmedspace +\negmedspace 1)$ won't run before
$foo(T)$ finishes, without imposing explicit intercycle prerequisites
that would require special treatment at startup (when there is no
previous cycle).  It also ensures that tasks with no prerequisites, e.g.\
{\em downloader} and {\em nztide}, won't all try to run at once.
Tasks are not deleted immediately on abdication (see below).


\subsubsection{Task Interaction} 

Each task keeps track of which of its postrequisites are completed, and
asks the other tasks if they can satisfy any of its prerequisites.  The
fact that task objects do not need to know who is supposed to satisfy
their prerequisites (because they can ask, indiscriminately, every other
task in the system) makes the task interaction (sequencing!) algorithm
almost trivial. The fact that most of these interactions are fruitless
is of no consequence. 

{\small
\noindent
\rule{5cm}{.2mm}
\begin{lstlisting}
class task_pool( Pyro.core.ObjBase ):
    # ...
    def interact( self ):
        # get each task to ask all the others if 
        # they can satisfy its prerequisites
        #--
        for task in self.tasks:
            task.get_satisfaction( self.tasks )
    # ...
\end{lstlisting}
}

\subsubsection{Running Tasks}

Each task object can launch its associated external task, and enter the
{\em running} state if its prerequisites are all satisfied, any existing
older tasks of the same type are already {\em finished}, and fewer than
{\em MAX\_ RUNAHEAD} finished tasks of the same type still exist (this
stops tasks with no prerequisites from running ahead indefinitely).

\subsubsection{Pyro Remote Method Calls}

The Pyro request handling loop executes remote method calls coming in
from external tasks, and returns after at least one call was handled.
Pyro must be run in non-default single-threaded mode (see Appendix
\ref{pyro-appendix}).

\subsubsection{Dumping State} 

The current state (waiting, running, or finished) of each task is
written out to the {\em state dump file}.  This provides a running
snapshot of the system as it runs, and just prior to shutdown or
failure. The controller can optionally start up by loading the state
dump (which can be edited first). Any 'running' tasks are reloaded in
the 'waiting' state.

\subsubsection{Removing Spent Tasks} 

A task is spent if it finished {\em and} no longer needed to satisfy the
prequisites of any other task. Most tasks are only needed by other
cotemporal downstream tasks; these can be removed when they are finished
{\em and} older than the oldest non-finished task. For rare cases that
are needed by tasks in later reference times (e.g.\ nzlam post
processing: multiple hourly topnet tasks need the same most recent
previously finished 06 or 18Z nzlam post processing task), each
non-finished task reports its {\em cutoff reference time} which is the
oldest reference time that may contain tasks still needed to satisfy its
own prerequisites (if it is waiting) or those of its immediate
post-abdication successor (if it is running already), then the task
manager can then kill any finished tasks that are also older than the
oldest task cutoff time.

\subsubsection{Removing Lame Tasks} 

Tasks that will never run (because their prerequisites cannot be
satisfied by any other task in the system) are removed from the {\em
oldest batch} of tasks.  If not removed they would prevent the spent
task deletion algorithm from working properly. Lame tasks can only be
detected in the oldest task batch; in younger batches some tasks may yet
appear as their predecessors abdicate.

Lame tasks are abdicated rather than just deleted, because their
descendents will not necessarily be lame: e.g.\ if the system is started
at 12Z with topnet turned on, all topnet tasks from 12Z through 17Z will
be valid but lame, because they will want to take input from a
non-existent nzlam\_post from 06Z prior to startup. However, the
presence of lame tasks may indicate user error: e.g.\ if you forget
to turn on task type $foo$ that supplies input to task type $bar$,
any instance of $bar$ will be lame.


\subsection{Dummy Mode}

Dummy mode allows complete testing of the control system without running
any real external tasks\footnote{The only difference between dummy mode
and real operation, as far as the controller is concerned, is that
external dummy tasks are not delayed by resource contention.}. When it
is ready to run, a task object will launch an external dummy program
that (i) gets a list of postrequisites from the parent task object and
then (ii) reports back that each one is satisfied at the (estimated)
right time relative to an accelerated dummy clock. Dummy tasks therefore
complete in approximately the same dummy clock time as the real tasks do
in real time. An initial dummy clock offset relative to the initial
reference time can also be specified, which allows simulation of the
transition between catchup and real time operation. Log messages are
stamped with dummy clock time instead of real time.

The same script is used for all external dummy tasks but it has special
behaviour in certain cases: the dummy downloader ``waits for incoming
files'' until 3:15 past its reference time, and the dummy topnet ``waits
for stream flow data'' until 0:15 past its reference time.

The dummy clock can be bumped forward a number of hours by remote
control, while the system is running. This affects the postrequisite
timing of running tasks correctly, but if it causes a running task to
finish immediately the next task in line will still start from the
beginning no matter how big the bump.


\appendix

\section{Essential OOP Concepts}

The simplicity of the dynamic sequencing implementation in {\em sequenz}
is critically dependent on the {\em polymorphic} nature of the {\em task
objects} in the program.  This section contains a minimal introduction
to these Object Oriented Programming concepts.  Refer to any OOP
reference for more detail.

\subsection{Classes and Objects}

A {\em class} is essentially a generalisation of {\em data type} to
include {\em behaviour} (i.e.\ functions or {\em methods}) as well as
state.  {\em Objects} are more or less self contained {\em instances} of
a class. For example, a $shape$ class could define a $position$ data
member that describes the location of each shape object, a $move()$
method that causes a shape object to alter its position, and a $draw()$
method that causes it to display itself in the right place on screen.

\subsection{Inheritance}

A {\em derived class} or {\em subclass} inherits the properties (methods
and data members) of a {\em base class}. It can also {\em override}
specific base class properties, or add new properties that aren't
present in the base class. Calling a particular method on an object
invokes the object's own class method if one is defined, otherwise the
immediate base class is searched, and so on down to the root of the
inheritance graph. 

For example, we could derive a $circle$ class from $shape$, adding a
`radius' data member and overriding the $draw()$ to get circle objects
to display themselves as actual circles.  Because we didn't override the
$move()$ method, calling $circle.move()$ would invoke the base class
method, $shape.move()$. 


\subsection{Polymorphism}

Polymorphism is the ability of one type to appear as and be used like
another type.  In OOP languages with inheritance, this usually refers to
the ability to treat derived/sub-class objects as if they were members
of a base class.  In particular, a group of mixed-type objects can all
be treated as members of a common base class. For example, we could
construct a list of $shape$ objects from $circles$, $triangles$, and
$squares$; calling $[list member].draw()$ will invoke the right derived
class $draw()$. This is a very powerful mechanism because {\em it allows
unmodified old code to call new code}: if we later derive an entirely
new kind of shape ($hexagon$, say) with it's own unique behaviour, the
existing program, without modification, will process the new objects in
the proper hexagon-specific way.


\section{Threading in Pyro} \label{pyro-appendix}

With Pyro in {\em single threaded mode}, \verb#handleRequests()# returns
after {\em either} a timeout has occurred {\em or} at least one request
(i.e.\ remote method call) was handled. With \verb#timeout = None# this
allows us to process tasks {\em only} after remote method invocations
come in.  Further, we can detect the remote calls that actually change
task states, and thereby drop into the task processing code only when
necessary, which minimizes non-useful output from the task processing
loop (e.g.\ in dummy mode there are a lot of remote calls on the dummy
clock object, which does not alter tasks at all). 

In {\em multithreaded mode}, \verb#handleRequests()# returns immediately
after creating a new request handling thread for a single remote object
and thereafter remote method calls on that object come in asynchronously
in the dedicated thread. This is not good for the dynamic sequencing
algorithm because tasks are only set running in the task processing
block which can be delayed while \verb#handleRequests()# blocks waiting
for a new connection to be established even as messages that warrent
task processing are coming in on existing connections. The only way
around this is to do task processing on \verb#handleRequests()# timeouts
which results in a lot of unnecessary task processing when nothing
important is happening.

\section{Miscellaneous Notes}

(To be incorporated into the main documentation, or deleted).

\subsection{catchup mode}

Note that ``correct model sequencing'' is not equivalent to ``orderly
generation of products by reference time''.  Nzlam can run continuously,
regardless of the downstream processing that depends on it.

Catchup mode is now task-dependent, rather than a property of the whole
system (as it is if only tasks from the same reference time can run at
once).  Where this matters, it can be detected by the relevant external
task. E.g.\ if the external topnet(T) task starts up at real time t
greater than the stream flow data time for T (i.e.\ $T+15$ min), i.e.\ the
required stream flow data is already available, then we're still in
catchup. If, on the other hand, the topnet task finds that it has to
wait for its stream flow data time to arrive, then we're caught up to
real time.  This matters because topnet is allowed to run ahead by a
different amount of time depending on whether we're in catchup mode or
not.


\subsection{controlling when a task executes}

\begin{itemize}
 \item  prerequisites
 \item artificial prerequisites (e.g.\ make nztide depend on nzlam)
 \item delayed instantiation (a task can't run if it doesn't exist yet).
 \item other contraints based on, for example, the number of previous
 instances that still exist in the system.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{fuzzy prequisites}

{\em Exact prerequisites} (most tasks): times are specified exactly,
relative to the task's own reference time.  E.g.\ {\em file foo\_{T}.nc
ready} where T is the task's reference time.

{\em Fuzzy prerequisites} (topnet): a time boundary is specified
relative to the task's own reference time; any task with a reference
time greater than or equal to the boundary time can satisify the
prerequisite.

\subsection{Task Messaging}

To the task objects, outputs are just {\em messages} indicating that the
external task has reached a significant waypoint, such as generation of
a particular output file.

\section{To Do}

\begin{itemize}

\item
 retrofit proper exception handling throughout (currently used sparsely and 
  inconsistently)

\item
 potential bug in the free task class: will never run if too many
 previous instances exist that are newer than the task deletion cutoff

\item
 remote logging from messaging and dummy task scripts, in case the
 controller itself is dead.

\end{itemize}
