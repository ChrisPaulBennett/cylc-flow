LaTeX source for sequenz documentation: Generate the final ps or pdf
documents in the source repository before installing elsewhere for use 
(some source files are read into the document during LaTeX processing
so relative file paths must be as expected at document processing time).

notes directory: temporary documentation files whose contents should 
eventually make it into the main documentation.
