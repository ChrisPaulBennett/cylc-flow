LaTeX source for cylc documentation: Generate the final ps or pdf
documents in the source repository before installing elsewhere for use 
(some source files are read into the document during LaTeX processing
so relative file paths must be as expected at document processing time).

The notes directory is for temporary documentation files whose contents
might eventually end up in the main documentation files.
