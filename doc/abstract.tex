    {\em Cylc} (pronounced ``silk'') is an advanced
    metascheduler\footnote{A metascheduler determines when dependent
    jobs are {\em ready} to run, at which point they can be sent to a
    batch queue scheduler. We drop the ``meta'' prefix from here on,
    however, because a metascheduler is also a type of scheduler. The
    term can also refer to a single aggregate view of multiple
    distributed resource managers, but that is not the topic of this
    document.} for cycling environmental forecast suites containing many
    interdependent scientific models and associated data processing
    tasks.\footnote{A {\em task} is any group of processes treated as a
    single entity for scheduling purposes.} Cylc is internally
    self-organising:\footnote{Prior to version 3.0 cylc's suite design
    interface reflected this too - a suite was defined solely by a set
    of distinct ``task definition files'' that just specified inputs and
    outputs; now, however, one specifies the suite dependency graph up
    front.} its novel scheduling algorithm allows an evolving pool of
    task proxy objects to resolve dependencies amongst themselves so
    that correct scheduling emerges naturally at run time.  Cylc does
    not group tasks artificially by forecast cycle,\footnote{For our
    purposes a {\em forecast cycle} comprises all tasks with a common
    {\em cycle time}, i.e.\ the analysis time or nominal start time of a
    forecast model, or that of the forecast model(s) associated with the
    other tasks.} and its task proxies are individually self-spawning
    (i.e.\ there is no ``global suite forecast cycle'') so that tasks
    from multiple forecast cycles can run at once to the full extent
    allowed by the real inter- and intra-cycle dependencies. This
    matters in particular whenever the external driving
    data\footnote{Forecast systems are typically driven by observational
    data and/or timely model fields from an external forecasting
    system.} for upcoming cycles are available in advance: cylc suites
    can catch up from delays very quickly, parallel test suites can be
    started or restarted behind the main operation to catch up quickly,
    and one can likewise achieve much greater throughput in historical
    case studies. The usual sequence of distinct forecast cycles emerges
    naturally as a suite catches up to real time operation.  Cylc is
    easily interfaced to existing tasks and is extremely flexible.
    Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of operation, and
    they dynamically adapt to insertion and removal of tasks, and to
    delays or failures in particular tasks or in the external
    environment: tasks not directly affected will carry on cycling as
    normal while the problem is addressed, after which time the affected
    tasks will catch up as quickly as possible. Cylc's handling of
    forecast model restart dependencies, and ability to
    recursively remove entire sub-trees of tasks, allows continued
    operation, with very little intervention, over major failures that
    require omitted forecasts in the driving models. Cylc suites can be
    distributed across a heterogenous network. Cylc has comprehensive
    graphical and command line interfaces, and many advanced userspace
    features: job databases, simulation mode, suite validation,
    dependency graph plotting, centralised alert hooks for failures and
    timeouts, cryptographically secure suites, \ldots

    %\footnote{Cylc also
    %enables new modes of real time operation, for example a catchment
    %river model that runs hourly assimilating real time stream flow
    %observations and using the {\em most recent} 6-hourly precipitation
    %forecast - see EcoConnect, below).}
