sequenz systems (i.e. sets of related tasks to be controlled by sequenz)
should be defined and maintained in their own repositories with version
tags to indicate which version of sequenz they are compatible with. This
allows sequenz development to continue without having to constantly
upgrade multiple task sets in the main repository.
