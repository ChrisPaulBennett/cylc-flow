cycon systems (i.e. sets of related tasks to be controlled by cycon)
should be defined and maintained in their own repositories with version
tags to indicate which version of cycon they are compatible with. This
allows cycon development to continue without having to constantly
upgrade multiple task sets in the main repository.
