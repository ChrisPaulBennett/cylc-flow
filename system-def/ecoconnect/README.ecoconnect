To date, sequenz development has occurred in parallel with the
development of the topnet-test system. The full operational ecoconnect
system is still in a very rudimentary state, however it includes the
topnet-test tasks as a subset and these will need to be updated from
the completed topnet-test system as soon as we resume work on the
operational system.

This file can be deleted once that occurs.
